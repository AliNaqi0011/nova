                Nova Resume was born from a simple observation: creating a professional resume 
                shouldn't be complicated, expensive, or time-consuming. We noticed that many 
                talented individuals were being held back not by their skills or experience, 
                but by their inability to present themselves effectively on paper.

              <p className="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Our platform combines the power of modern web technology with intuitive design 
                to make resume creation accessible to everyone. Whether you're a recent graduate, 
                career changer, or seasoned professional, Nova Resume provides the tools you need 
                to showcase your unique value proposition.
